    <p>The UEFA Euro 2020 final was an association football match between Italy and England that took place at Wembley Stadium in
    London, England, on 11 July 2021 to determine the winner of UEFA Euro 2020. It was the 16th final of the UEFA European 
    Championship, a quadrennial tournament contested by the senior men's national teams of the member associations of UEFA to 
    decide the champions of Europe. Originally scheduled for 12 July 2020, the match had been postponed along with the rest of the
    tournament due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe.</p>

    <p>In front of a crowd of 67,173, limited by COVID-19 restrictions, with an estimated global audience of 328 million, Italy won 
    their second European Championship, beating first-time finalists England 3–2 in a penalty shoot-out following a 1–1 draw after
    extra time. England's Luke Shaw opened the scoring in the second minute of the match, the fastest goal ever scored in a
    European Championship final, only for Leonardo Bonucci – who was later named the man of the match – to equalise midway
    through the second half. England had a 2–1 advantage in the shoot-out after two kicks each, only for their last three 
    takers to miss; Italy came back to win 3–2.</p>
        
    <p>It was Italy's first major title since the 2006 FIFA World Cup and their first European Championship since winning it on
    home soil in 1968; in terms of European Championship titles, it put Italy level with France on two titles, and one title
    behind Spain and Germany. England became the third nation in the 21st century to lose the European Championship final on 
    home soil after Portugal in 2004 and France in 2016. After the match, England's unsuccessful penalty takers
    (Marcus Rashford, Jadon Sancho and Bukayo Saka) were subjected to racial abuse on social media which was investigated
    by the Metropolitan Police. The event was also marred by crowd disorder, incidents of violence before and after the
    game, and later COVID-19 exposure.</p>
